BookBot is the first project of Boot.Dev
<br/>
This project was an excellent way to dive into Python and get a solid understanding of working with it!
<br/>
BookBot takes a text file and tells you how many words can be found in it along with how many times each letter was found! 
<br/>
(Not something I think anyone would want to do manually ðŸ˜‚)
